My Comments:
Lectures are so long and so many examples are given for the course. I took course for taking credits in Computer Vision domain.
So I didn't work too much and passed. I learn something about visualization which is good. However course is not a person who interested in 
visualization in data science. It mostly shows 3D visualization techniques and how they are implemented.
